# Brief explanation

This repository contains some python files that I used for a pilot analysis
to quantify beating and contractility in IPS-CMs using microscopy data 
(ie movies of beating IPS-CMs with high acquisition rate).

Currently, many project files reside in the ./dev directory, as this repository
is under development.

/(Update 2024/03.)/ I now moved most of the actual analysis code to functions,
and there's an example on how to run this pipeline in the `main_analysis_example.py`
file.
