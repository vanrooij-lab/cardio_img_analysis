# Brief explanation

This repository contains some python files that I used for a pilot analysis
to quantify beating and contractility in IPS-CMs using microscopy data 
(ie movies of beating IPS-CMs with high acquisition rate).

Currently, many project files reside in the ./dev directory, as this repository
is under development.
